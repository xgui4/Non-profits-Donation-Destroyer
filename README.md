# Non-profits Donation-Destroyer++

This is a simple Google Chrome Extension which does 3 simple things:

1. Blocks the Wikipedia "Donate or Wikipedia will die in 3 minutes!" popups.
2. Displays the true financials of Wikipedia in a small, closable box.
3. Provides a "See if this page is available on Grokipedia" link.

The "Not-profits" Donation Destroyer will also display financial data for other Tech Foundations if you are on their websites.

Just for good measure.
