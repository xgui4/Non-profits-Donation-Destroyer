# Wikipedia Donation Destroyer

This is a simple browser extension which does 3 things (and 3 things only)

1. Blocks the Wikipedia "Donate or Wikipedia will die in 3 minutes!" popups.
2. Displays the true financials of Wikipedia and others similar sites in a small, closable box.
3. Provides a "See if this page is available on Grokipedia" link (for wikipedia articles only).

The "Not-profits" Donation Destroyer will also display financial data for other Tech Foundations if you are on their websites.

Just for good measure.

The code is simple. No data is collected. No trackers or advertisements.

You're welcome.
